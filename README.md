these are my codes for the assignments and quizzes given in the bbm104 class in Hacettepe Uni.

bbm104 is the programming lab class for the second term in Hacettepe Computer Science, and it's main goal is to make an introduction to the OOP principles with java.

introductions about the assignments and quizzes are in the pdfs carrying the same name as the folders.

example input - output files can be found in the "io" folders.
