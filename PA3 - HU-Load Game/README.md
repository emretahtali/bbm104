project overview:
---

developed a mining game named HU-Load, inspired by the Motherload game, focusing on game mechanics, UI design, and dynamic interaction using JavaFX. The objective was to collect as much money as possible by drilling for valuable minerals before the machine's fuel runs out.


key features:
---

user interface: designed using JavaFX for interactive game elements.

game mechanics: implemented a drill machine with attributes such as fuel, storage, and money bank.

dynamic controls: used arrow keys for machine navigation and ensured realistic physics with gravity and collision systems.

visual elements: included diverse underground elements such as soil, minerals, boulders, and lava, with randomized asset placements.

game logic: defined clear rules for fuel consumption, money collection, game over conditions (due to lava or fuel depletion), and different mineral values based on depth.

extra features: implemented smooth vertical scrolling and camera following mechanics for enhanced gameplay experience.
